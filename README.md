# Try-Catch
Practicing Try and Catch Errors

We must create a web interface for score subject entry that validates errors. The application has to be able of calculating the average score of each student, using the score got in the final exam and other 2 practical work scores previously done. If the average is higher than 7/10, then the student approve the subject.
